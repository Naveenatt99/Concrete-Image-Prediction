# Concrete-Image-Prediction
A CNN Model was developed using Pytorch and trained using labeled dataset of 40K images. The model resulted with a
training accuracy of 96% and testing accuracy of 93% approximately


This image classifier takes the input of the image and predicts whether the concrete image provided is cracked or not.
This model can be used in construction industry where manual labor can be reduced to check whether the concrete
provided is in good shape


Technology and Libraries Used: Torch, Torch Vision, Pillow, Glob, Pandas, NumPy, AWS Sagemaker
